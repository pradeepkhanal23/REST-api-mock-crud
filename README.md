# REST API CRUD Operations Practice

This project is a practice exercise for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a REST API. The application interacts with the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) API to manage TODO tasks.

## Features

- Create a new TODO task
- Read the list of existing TODO tasks
- Update an existing TODO task
- Delete a TODO task

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

## API Integration

This project utilizes the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) API for performing CRUD operations on TODO tasks. The built-in `fetch` function in JavaScript is used to interact with the API endpoints.

## Limitations

- This project is intended for practice purposes and may not cover all edge cases or error handling scenarios.
- The JSONPlaceholder API is a mock API and does not provide actual persistent data storage. Changes made to the tasks are not permanently saved.
- The project does not include authentication or user-specific functionality.
